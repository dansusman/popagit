Quickly initialize a new Git and GitHub repo for your local project.

I'm sick of always following the same manual workflow when I start up new
projects, so I made a little script to do it all for me.

No more opening GitHub on my overly private browser and logging in just to
create a new repo.

The script is pretty opinionated and extremely barebones. Maybe I'll improve it
to support more stuff in the future. i d k
